# SpecializedStorage
A vintage story mod which expands on the mining bag.

The mining bag is a very unique item, and I always wanted to see it expanded on, so this mod adds 16 new backpacks that the players can use, including early game bags pre-leather and sturdy upgrades. These backpacks are balanced around the base game mining bag, giving twice the storage amount of the avaliable backpack for that stage of the game. The resource cost of these items (including the mining bag itself) has been nerfed, costing more resources to make. Additionally, bags are upgrade into their sturdy counterparts rather than simply having two versions of the same item.

The new storage bags are not all evenly distributed amoung the various item types, since some item categories are more useful than others. This encourages players to think more constructively about the avaliable items and what's worth it and why.

Mod may not be compatable with other storage mods due to just how many storage flags it uses. Additionally, it currently has no compatability files added in. New modded materials may or may not work with the bags based on how the item is implimented.
